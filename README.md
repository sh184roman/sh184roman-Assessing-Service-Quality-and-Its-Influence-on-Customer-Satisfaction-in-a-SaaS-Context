# Assessing Service Quality and Its Influence on Customer Satisfaction in a SaaS Context of Pragati IT Solution, Nepal
Abstract


This study investigates the dimensions of service quality and its influence on customer satisfaction within the Software as a Service (SaaS) context of Pragati IT Solution, Nepal, which is a rapidly growing provider of cloud-based Information Management System (IMS) software for educational institutions in Nepal. Despite the SaaS service quality has been widely researched in developed countries, limited empirical studies exist in the context of underdeveloped countries like Nepal. This study is guided by the SaaS-Qual framework developed by Benlian et al. (2011), adopts a positivist philosophy, deductive approach, mono-method quantitative design, and cross-sectional survey strategy to assess key service quality dimensions such as responsiveness, rapport, reliability, feature, flexibility and security. Primary data were collected from 129 active SaaS users through a structured questionnaire and analysed using descriptive statistics, reliability and validity tests, Principal Component Analysis, correlation analysis, and regression modelling.

Findings of the study indicate that flexibility, reliability, and features are the strongest constructs for shaping users’ perception of service quality of Pragati IT Solution, Nepal, whereas responsiveness, rapport, and security also contribute meaningfully but with lower relative influence. Furthermore, the relationship between service quality and overall customer satisfaction is positive but with a weak association, which suggests that overall customer satisfaction is not only influenced by service quality but also by other contextual factors such as usability, expectations, organisational needs, and cost-value perceptions etc (Delone and McLean, 2003). High multicollinearity among service quality dimensions further suggests that users evaluate SaaS quality as an integrated experience rather than isolated attributes (Jimenez Fernandez and Ruiz Martos, 2020).

This study contributes context-specific empirical evidence to the limited SaaS service quality and customer satisfaction research in Nepal and offers actionable recommendations, such as enhancing system flexibility, strengthening reliability, optimising feature design, and improving the user support mechanism for Pragati IT Solution and other Nepalese SaaS providers (Good, Mangus and Ellen Bolman Pullins, 2023). The research also highlights methodological and practical limitations and identifies opportunities for future studies to explore mediating variables and longitudinal user experience in Nepal’s evolving SaaS ecosystem.
